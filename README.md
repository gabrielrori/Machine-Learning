# Machine Learning Repository

This repository focuses on machine learning. The repository features several Jupyter notebooks that walk you through various theoretical concepts and their practical implementations.

## Contents

1. **Arrays and tensor operations.ipynb**  
    - This notebook covers the basics of array and tensor operations, two fundamental elements in data mining and machine learning.

2. **Linear Regression.ipynb**  
    - Python implementation of Linear Regression, an essential predictive modelling estimation technique.

3. **Logistic Regression.ipynb**  
    - Discusses Logistic Regression, a classification algorithm, including a detailed Python implementation.

4. **Dataset and training.ipynb**  
    - Datasets, training parameters and the various considerations that come into play when training our machine learning models.

5. **GANs MNIST.ipynb**  
    - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), implementing a GAN model using Python and testing it on the MNIST dataset.
